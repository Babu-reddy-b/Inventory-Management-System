Developed an Inventory Management System with a frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, complemented by Express.js for backend server management. Users could enter queries through a text box, which were processed to display relevant data such as stock levels and item details. The backend, built on a DBMS, ensured efficient data retrieval, updates, and report generation, providing real-time inventory tracking and control.
